# jsonresume-theme-clean-tweaks
This is my version of the theme [jsonresume-theme-clean](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonresume-theme-clean).

The code has been heavily modified to suit my own needs for a resume template - feel free to fork it!

Note: I am not using the jsonresume cli - just compiling the handlebars template to keep things simpler.
