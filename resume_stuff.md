# Steven's Feedback
- You can remove your AA role.
- I also question if Eagle Scout is necessary unless you can relate your project to what you’re doing.
- Also (I could be completely wrong in this, so take with a grain of salt), I wouldn’t trust that people looking will click on your GitHub.
    - If you can, put some of your side projects on your resume that highlight your skill in specific CS/Coding/Building/etc. areas.
- I also need to trust that your industry-relevant items are using the right verbs...not sure if they do or don’t. But in my field they’d be weak.
- You might consider putting a summary of qualifications at the top.
    - It would be your quick hits that will entice people to read further.
- Yeah...mostly just word variety. Turn “Worked” into something more CS descriptive.
